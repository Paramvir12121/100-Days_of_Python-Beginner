# List Comprehension
It is a way to create a list from previous list.

- Using something like this:   new_list = [new_item for item in list]

- It is unique to python and makes code a lot shorther.

- Not limited to list, can also be a string, dict, etc

- We can also set conditions to what could be added to the list eg. : new_list = [new_item for item in list if test]



# Dictionary Comprehension
it is used to create a Dict from list or dict
- To create from list: new_dict = {new_key:new_value for item in list}

- To create form dict: new_dict = {new_key:new_value for (key,value) in dict.items()}
